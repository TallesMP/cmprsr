Opinion polling for the 2024 United Kingdom general election was carried out by various organisations to gauge voting intention. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the British Polling Council (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules. The opinion polls listed range from the previous election on 12 December 2019 to the election on Thursday, 4 July 2024.[1]
Graphical summaries

The Conservatives led the polls for the two years following the 2019 general election, which included Brexit, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout during the leadership of Boris Johnson. Labour took a lead following the Partygate scandal and maintained this through the Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak premierships until the 2024 election.

Guide to tables

Poll results are listed in the tables below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each poll is displayed in bold, and its background is shaded in the leading party's colour. The "lead" column shows the percentage point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. When a poll result is a tie, the figures with the highest percentages are shaded and displayed in bold.

"Green" in these tables refers to combined totals for the green parties in the United Kingdom, namely the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Greens, and, for polls of the entire UK, the Green Party Northern Ireland. The three parties share a commitment to environmental policies, but are independent of one another, with each contesting elections only in its own region.

The polling company ComRes was acquired by Savanta in July 2019.[2] It was rebranded as Savanta ComRes in November 2019[3] and as Savanta in December 2022.[4] In August 2023, the market research company Omnisis rebranded its public polling arm as We Think.[5] In October 2023, the Norstat group acquired Panelbase.[6] In November 2023, Kantar Public rebranded to Verian.[7] None of these organisational changes entailed changes in methodology.
National poll results

Most national opinion polls do not cover Northern Ireland, which has different major political parties from the rest of the United Kingdom. This distinction is made in the tables below in the area column, where "GB" means Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), and "UK" means the entire United Kingdom. Plaid Cymru only stand candidates in Wales and the Scottish National Party (SNP) only stand candidates in Scotland.
2024

When compared to the result, the final week of polls on average underestimated the Conservative and Liberal Democrat vote shares and overestimated the Labour and Reform vote shares. The projected SNP and Green vote shares were largely accurate.[8]

Seat projections

The general election was contested under the first-past the post electoral system in 650 constituencies. 326 seats were needed for a parliamentary majority.

Most polls were reported in terms of the overall popular vote share, and the pollsters did not typically project how these shares would equate to numbers of seats in the House of Commons.
Projections from aggregators

Various models existed which continually projected election outcomes for the seats in Britain based on the aggregate of polling data. Final predictions of some notable models are tabulated below.

MRP and SRP polls

Multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) was used by YouGov to predict outcomes for the 2017 and 2019 elections.[67][68] Multiple polling companies conducted such polling and modelling for the 2024 election, these are tabulated below. Also included is a stacked regression with poststratification (SRP) poll produced by J.L. Partners, the first time such a method has been used for a UK election.[69] All of these polls use sample sizes substantially larger than typical national polls.

These polls were of Britain only, though the reporting of some results include the 18 Northern Irish seats under "Others". Polling companies also differ in their handling of the Speaker's seat, considering it variously as Labour, "Other", or omitting it from the results. Negative values in the rightmost "majority" column below indicate that the party with the most seats would have a plurality of seats, but would not have a majority. The overall vote share values for these polls, where reported, are also included in the tables above.

Exit poll

An exit poll conducted by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV, and Sky News was published at the end of voting at 22:00, predicting the number of seats for each party.[72]
Parties 	Seats 	Change
	Labour Party[p] 	410 	Increase 209
	Conservative Party 	131 	Decrease 241
	Liberal Democrats 	61 	Increase 53
	Reform UK 	13 	Increase 13
	Scottish National Party 	10 	Decrease 38
	Plaid Cymru 	4 	Increase 2
	Green Party 	2 	Increase 1
	Others[q] 	19 	Increase 1
Labour majority of 170

The extent of Labour's victory was projected to be slightly less than seen in the last week of opinion polls, though still a substantial landslide. The exit poll ended up being close to the actual results, apart from the Reform figure which was slightly overestimated.
BBC updated forecasts

Throughout the night and into the early hours of 5 July, BBC News updated their forecast, combining the exit poll with the results coming in.[73][74][75]

Notes

Stacked regression with poststratification.
Methodology change.[9]
The headline voting intention figures are calculated by YouGov from its MRP seat projections.
Values calculated from the weighted responses for each party, after excluding Don't Know and Would Not Vote.
The published lead was 15 points. This is not apparent from the party numbers due to rounding.
Includes Plaid Cymru.
Survation also polled voting intention if Liz Truss were Prime Minister, which saw Labour on 46%, the Conservatives on 29%, Liberal Democrats on 11% and others on 12%.
Opinium announced they had amended their methodology, so it cannot be compared directly to previous Opinium polls.
Includes Speaker Lindsay Hoyle's Chorley seat which none of the main parties are contesting.
Polling was of GB adults only, but 18 seats were assigned to Northern Irish parties in the reporting of the outcome.
Jeremy Corbyn, the independent candidate for Islington North
First MRP to take into account new constituency boundaries
"The baseline MRP by Focaldata predicted Labour winning 469 seats and the Conservatives 128 seats. 'Don't Know' was predicted to win two seats, namely Aberdeenshire North and Moray East; as well as Boston and Skegness. Given in a General Election scenario 'Don't Know' would not be on the ballot paper, we reallocated these seats to the party in second place. This meant that we awarded Aberdeenshire North and Moray East to the Labour Party; and then Boston and Skegness to the Conservatives in all scenarios and analyses that we performed."
10,010 sample, 20–26 October 2022; 2,000 sample, 28–30 October 2022.[70] "The MRP poll by Focaldata of 10,010 people, on behalf of the internationalist campaign group Best for Britain, was conducted about the time of Truss's resignation and updated with an MRP poll of 2,000 people after Sunak took over."[71]
517 listed; one seat (Clacton) is reported as "Don't Know", but "in reality the seat would be won by Labour", and is therefore added to Labour's projected total seat count.[70]
The Speaker is included in the Labour figure.
This includes the 18 seats in Northern Ireland and 1 other in Great Britain.
The Speaker is included in the Labour figures.

    First forecast:
    18 in NI
    1 in GB

    Second forecast:
    18 in NI
    4 in GB

    Third forecast:
    18 in NI
    4 in GB
